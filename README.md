# rladiesnyc_talk_11_06_2018

Abstract:

Often, data scientists are tasked with communicating their results with 
people in the workplace who do not share the same technical background. 
Bridging the gaps between parties can be a perilous journey. 
In this talk, I will discuss how I have attempted to navigate this 
tricky terrain and provide some pointers for clear language use 
and data visualization choices. Iâ€™ll demonstrate how I pass on 
insights through visualizations using packages such as ggridges 
and ggalluvial and how I use rmarkdown to craft reports and 
take my coworkers on data adventures.
